He and his brother lived in the family home their whole life so, despite the higher cost, it was important to him that the hearse left directly from the house.</div>

        <div class="bare__description">Brian is quite frail and doesn’t drive so chose the optional limousine service for himself and other members of the family. As people travelled a long way to attend the funeral he decided to opt for a service time later in the day, which was more convenient but costlier than an early morning service.</div>
